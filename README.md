# egg-webgl

This is the code I wrote to follow the course [Create 3D Graphics in JavaScript Using WebGL](https://egghead.io/courses/create-3d-graphics-in-javascript-using-webgl) by [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

Unfortunately, "live edit" mode in IntelliJ does not work well when the JS code is in other file so I put everything together in a single html file.
